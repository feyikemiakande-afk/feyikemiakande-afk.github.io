## 🚀 Projects

### 📊 Global Billionaires Analysis (Excel)
Built an Excel dashboard to analyse global billionaire wealth and uncover patterns across countries, industries, and demographics. The project focuses on data cleaning, aggregation, and visual storytelling to highlight wealth distribution and concentration trends. 

**Key Findings:**
- Wealth is heavily concentrated in a small number of countries and industries
- Technology and finance consistently dominate global billionaire rankings

**Why It Matters:**
These insights help illustrate global wealth inequality and identify industries that drive high net-worth growth, supporting economic analysis and strategic investment discussions.

**Focus:** Trend identification, segmentation analysis, insight communication  
**Tools:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Charts

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
Conducted exploratory data analysis on a real world dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships across key variables using python. The analysis involved imporatation of a raw uncleaned data, cleaning the raw data, handling missing values, summarising metrics, and grouping data to support structured investigation.

**Key Findings:**
- Certain variables showed strong relationships, indicating potential drivers of outcomes
- Data quality issues significantly influenced early analytical result

**Why It Matters:**
The analysis demonstrates how proper data preparation and exploration are critical for reliable insights and informed decision making before advanced analysis or modelling.

**Focus:** Pattern discovery, data preparation and cleaning, analytical reasoning  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 📈 Amazon Sales Performance Analysis (Power BI)

Analysed an Amazon sales dataset to evaluate business performance using KPIs such as total sales, sales quantity, and average order value. Developed an interactive dashboard to identify sales trends and performance patterns, supporting data-driven decisions related to inventory planning, sales performance monitoring, and revenue optimisation.

**Key Findings:**
- A small number of products and regions generated a disproportionate share of total revenue
- Sales exhibited clear seasonal trends with identifiable peak periods

**Why It Matters:**
These insights support inventory planning, sales performance monitoring, revenue optimisation, and investigation of order cancellations, enabling more data-driven commercial decisions.

**Focus:** KPI analysis, performance analysis
**Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling

## 🗄️ Student Performance Analysis (SQL, MySQL)**
Analysed a 1,000+ record student performance dataset to explore academic outcomes across math, reading, and writing scores. The analysis focuses on understanding overall performance, comparing outcomes across student groups, and examining factors associated with differences in results.

**Key Findings**
- Average performance differs across subjects, indicating uneven strengths in math, reading, and writing.
- Student performance varies across demographic and socio-economic factors such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and race/ethnicity.
- Students who completed a test preparation course achieved higher average total scores than those who did not.
- High performance across all three subjects is relatively uncommon.
- Most students clustered within mid-range total score values, with fewer students at performance extremes.

**Why It Matters**
These findings help illustrate how background and preparation-related factors are associated with academic performance. Such insights can support targeted academic interventions, resource allocation, and evaluation of preparation programs.

**Tools: SQL (MySQL)**
**Focus: Aggregation, comparative analysis, Descriptive statistics**
